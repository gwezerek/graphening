Goals for today:

Dynamically set x domain to range across colors
	For each dimension create flattened array of all keys in each color.dimension
	Save that extent to rollups.color.dimension.xDomain
Dynamically set y domain to range across colors
	For each dimension create flattened array of all values in each color.dimension
	Save that extent to rollups.color.dimension.Domain
Hide undefined
Add numbers up top
Update template text with how many are undefined


If dimension is CMC, power or toughness
	If +value is not a number, return 'other'
	If +value is integer between 1 and 9, return it
	if +value is higher than 9, return '10+'

Else
	return value
